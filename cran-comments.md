Package was archived on CRAN
CRAN repository db overrides:

* The package was archived because of a test that was sporadically failing on one of the CRAN test machines used to run Additional tests (MKL). I have now re-factored the function and I think that the test should no longer fail. To be safe, I have also set the failing test to be skipped on CRAN. I also violated the CRAN policy against sending html-formatted email to a CRAN maintainer, for which I sincerely apologize. I will certainly be very careful to avoid this in the future.

* The note concerns four DOI links in the documentation which are supposedly invalid:

Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:

I believe these messages can safely be ignored, since all of the links in question load fine in my web browser.
