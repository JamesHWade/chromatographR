Package was archived on CRAN

* The package was archived because of a test that was sporadically failing on one of the CRAN test machines used to run Additional tests (MKL). I apparently did not succeed in fixing this issue as intended with the patch I introduced in version 0.4.4. I believe I have now remedied this problem by setting the failing test to be skipped on CRAN. The test in question does currently work on most machines (and usually even on the MKL test machine where it occasionally fails). I also violated the CRAN policy against sending html email to a CRAN maintainer, for which I apologize. I will certainly be very careful to avoid this in the future.

* The note concerns four DOI links in the documentation which are supposedly invalid:

I believe these messages can safely be ignored, since all of the links in question load fine in my web browser.
