# chromatographR

`chromatographR` is a package for the reproducible analysis of HPLC-DAD chromatographic data in R.

### Installation

You can install chromatographR from GitHub:
```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ethanbass/chromatographR")
```

Or to build the vignette, include the argument `build_vignettes=TRUE` (note: this will take considerably longer than loading the package without building the vignette).

### Usage
Please see the vignette included with the package for details on the application of the `chromatographR` package for the analysis of HPLC data. Your data will need to be in `csv` format first.
