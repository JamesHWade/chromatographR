# chromatographR

`chromatographR` is a package for the reproducible analysis of HPLC-DAD chromatographic data in R.

### Installation

You can install `chromatographR` from GitHub using the devtools package:
```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/ethanbass/chromatographR/")
```

To build the vignette, include the argument `build_vignettes=TRUE` (**note:** this will take considerably longer than loading the package without building the vignette).

### Usage
Please see the vignette included with the package for details on the application of the `chromatographR` package for the analysis of HPLC data. Your data will need to be in `csv` format first.
