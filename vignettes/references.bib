  abstract = {Drug resistance mediated by clonal evolution is arguably the biggest problem in cancer therapy today. However, evolving resistance to one drug may come at a cost of decreased fecundity or increased sensitivity to another drug. These evolutionary trade-offs can be exploited using `evolutionary steering' to control the tumour population and delay resistance. However, recapitulating cancer evolutionary dynamics experimentally remains challenging. Here, we present an approach for evolutionary steering based on a combination of single-cell barcoding, large populations of 108\textendash 109 cells grown without re-plating, longitudinal non-destructive monitoring of cancer clones, and mathematical modelling of tumour evolution. We demonstrate evolutionary steering in a lung cancer model, showing that it shifts the clonal composition of the tumour in our favour, leading to collateral sensitivity and proliferative costs. Genomic profiling revealed some of the mechanisms that drive evolved sensitivity. This approach allows modelling evolutionary steering strategies that can potentially control treatment resistance.},

  abstract = {Collateral sensitivity (CS)-based antibiotic treatments, where increased resistance to one antibiotic leads to increased sensitivity to a second antibiotic, may have the potential to limit the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. However, it remains unclear how to best design CS-based treatment schedules. To address this problem, we use mathematical modelling to study the effects of pathogen- and drug-specific characteristics for different treatment designs on bacterial population dynamics and resistance evolution. We confirm that simultaneous and one-day cycling treatments could supress resistance in the presence of CS. We show that the efficacy of CS-based cycling therapies depends critically on the order of drug administration. Finally, we find that reciprocal CS is not essential to suppress resistance, a result that significantly broadens treatment options given the ubiquity of one-way CS in pathogens. Overall, our analyses identify key design principles of CS-based treatment strategies and provide guidance to develop treatment schedules to suppress resistance.},

The new features include a new similarity measure for comparing warped chromatograms, an insurance against peaks at the extremes of the chromatograms disappearing because of the warping, and the possibility to select and use multiple traces in searching the optimal alignment. Moreover, we present an alignment strategy combining global and individual alignments for aligning LC\textendash MS data that exhibit different shifts within the same sample, at the same retention time. Using an LC\textendash MS data set consisting of E. coli homogenates that were measured in several batches over a period of six months, we show the benefits of the improved algorithm and the merits of the new strategy. The algorithm is publicly available as the R package ptw.},

  abstract = {Bacterial adaptation to antibiotic combinations depends on the joint inhibitory effects of the two drugs (drug interaction [DI]) and how resistance to one drug impacts resistance to the other (collateral effects [CE]). Here we model these evolutionary dynamics on two-dimensional phenotype spaces that leverage scaling relations between the drug-response surfaces of drug-sensitive (ancestral) and drug-resistant (mutant) populations. We show that evolved resistance to the component drugs \textendash{} and in turn, the adaptation of growth rate \textendash{} is governed by a Price equation whose covariance terms encode geometric features of both the two-drug-response surface (DI) in ancestral cells and the correlations between resistance levels to those drugs (CE). Within this framework, mean evolutionary trajectories reduce to a type of weighted gradient dynamics, with the drug interaction dictating the shape of the underlying landscape and the collateral effects constraining the motion on those landscapes. We also demonstrate how constraints on available mutational pathways can be incorporated into the framework, adding a third key driver of evolution. Our results clarify the complex relationship between drug interactions and collateral effects in multidrug environments and illustrate how specific dosage combinations can shift the weighting of these two effects, leading to different and temporally explicit selective outcomes.},

  abstract = {A hybrid of exponential and Gaussian functions is developed as a model of asymmetric peak profiles. This exponential-Gaussian hybrid function (EGH) is mathematically simple, numerically stable, and its parameters are readily determined by making graphical measurements and applying simple equations. Furthermore, the statistical moments of the EGH function can be accurately approximated (within{$\pm$}0.15\% error) at any level of asymmetry using formulae that are easily programmed into a computer. These features of the EGH make it very easy to implement by most chromatographers. The EGH serves as a useful alternative to the exponentially modified Gaussian (EMG) for modeling slightly asymmetric peaks since the two models produce nearly the same profile at relatively low asymmetries. The EGH also serves as an addition to the extensive list of alternative models that are sometimes better than the EMG at describing highly asymmetric peaks. A comparison between EMG and EGH curves at various asymmetries is made by analysis of toluene, phenylalanine, and pyridine on a reversed-phase liquid chromatographic system.},

  abstract = {Summary: Pvclust is an add-on package for a statistical software R to assess the uncertainty in hierarchical cluster analysis. Pvclust can be used easily for general statistical problems, such as DNA microarray analysis, to perform the bootstrap analysis of clustering, which has been popular in phylogenetic analysis. Pvclust calculates probability values (p-values) for each cluster using bootstrap resampling techniques. Two types of p-values are available: approximately unbiased (AU) p-value and bootstrap probability (BP) value. Multiscale bootstrap resampling is used for the calculation of AU p-value, which has superiority in bias over BP value calculated by the ordinary bootstrap resampling. In addition the computation time can be enormously decreased with parallel computing option.Availability: The program is freely distributed under GNU General Public License (GPL) and can directly be installed from CRAN (), the official R package archive. The instruction and program source code are available at Contact:ryota.suzuki@is.titech.ac.jp},

  abstract = {Summary: Alignment of peaks across samples is a difficult but unavoidable step in the data analysis for all analytical techniques containing a separation step like chromatography. Important application examples are the fields of metabolomics and proteomics. Parametric time warping (PTW) has already shown to be very useful in these fields because of the highly restricted form of the warping functions, avoiding overfitting. Here, we describe a new formulation of PTW, working on peak-picked features rather than on complete profiles. Not only does this allow for a much more smooth integration in existing pipelines, it also speeds up the (already among the fastest) algorithm by orders of magnitude. Using two publicly available datasets we show the potential of the new approach. The first set is a LC\textendash DAD dataset of grape samples, and the second an LC\textendash MS dataset of apple extracts.Availability and implementation: Parametric time warping of peak lists is implemented in the ptw package, version 1.9.1 and onwards, available from Github (https://github.com/rwehrens/ptw) and CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org).
