Changes in version 0.2 w.r.t. 0.1
- implement overlapping segments! should be a real novelty _DONE_, Oct 24
- add quality criteria in summary _DONE_, Oct 20
- complete pipeline so that the output is an intensity matrix _DONE_
- add wrapper function for a complete analysis _DONE_ Nov 20
- add some parallellization support _IN PROGRESS_: some lapply
  statements have been changed into mclapply but the most
  time-consuming step, the ALS iterations, will remain slow. Different
  time windows are done in parallel, but some time windows require
  very few iterations, others require quite a lot. In addition, the
  ALS output is annoying. Also the warping can be slow with many components.
- add estimation of # of components
